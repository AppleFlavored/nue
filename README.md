# Nue
Nue is a bare-bones server implementation using [Minestom:CE](https://github.com/hollow-cube/minestom-ce).

## Configuration
Configuring Nue is done through the `config.toml` file. This file is autogenerated when the
server JAR is first ran. The default values can be found [here](src/main/resources/config.toml).

## Commands

* `/teleport` (alias: `/tp`)
* `/gamemode` (alias: `/gm`)

## Building
Before building, make sure you have Java 17 (or later) installed.

To build Nue, use the provided gradle wrapper and run the `shadowJar` task:
